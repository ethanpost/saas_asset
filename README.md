# saas_asset

 These objects are really just experimental at this point I don't recommend you do much more than look. There are a couple pages in my APEX demo application (Create Assets Example and Asset Detail) that represent the UI component to this code.

It is included in my Demo app for future reference. I like the idea but not the implementation. I will probably develop a future version of this at some point.

Thanks!
